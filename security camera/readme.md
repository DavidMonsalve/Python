# Security Camera

This app uses facial recognition to know when to record and save
mp4 files. Whenever a face gets detected the camera will start
recording a video until the face gets off the frame.

The recordings are stored in the same directory as the script.

IMPORTANT:
You have to install cv-open module in your terminal before you launch the program,
otherwise it's not going to work.
